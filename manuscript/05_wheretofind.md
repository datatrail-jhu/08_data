# Where to Find Data?

Now that we know what data are, the next question you should be asking is where to find data. In some cases you create your own data set but in other cases you need to use data that others have created. 

## Public versus private data

Before discussing where to find data, we need to know what privately-accessed and public data are. While you normally do now have access to privately-accessed data or restricted data, most public data are publicly and freely available. Note that sometimes you can access for private data by simply just requesting or paying for the data and sometimes even public data are avialable upon request. Most company data are private while most government data are public. 

## Sources of data

Data can be found from differernt sources. As you choose an occupation in data science, a lot of your job is to work with corportae data.
