# Ethics of Data Science

From your email and facebook to the advertisement you receive in your mail, data science has made its way in our every day lives. In many respects, it is here to help us (analysis of crime data or preventing spams in our mailboxes). But the impact can be devastating as well. For instance, Facebook has been accused of using algorithms prioritizing what people see on their Facebook news feed that may have potentially affected the U.S. election results in 2016. 

In other cases, algorithms have shown to be racially biased. Since a lot of these algorithms operate in a data driven manner, the decision that the algorithm makes (predictive policing or parole decisions) are based on the historical data given to the algorithm. Imagine a case where the police starts using an algorithm that suggests people who have an incarcerated parent are more likely to commit crime and arrest individuals based on the suggestions. The model may be based on actual data but is it ethical to use this algorithm?

It is common not to give much thought to the ethical implication of data analysis by saying "data do not lie" and "algorithms are impartial" but it's our responsibility to consider how our algorithms change lives. With your data science skills comes responsibility. Before considering any data analysis and publishing your results, make sure:

1. You have gone through your data and have made sure there is not any major flaw in your data collection. Data can be biased. You can't use the result of a study that is mostly based on data from men to say anything about women.
2. You have checked for common mistakes in your analysis and know that your methodology is valid and defensible. The sign of one variable can drastically change the result of your analysis.
3. The results of your work can not be used to harass people, especially minorities, in any way.
4. Your analysis is independent of your opinion about the specific problem you're trying to solve using data. Ronald Coase, Nobel prize winner in economics, criticizing biases in data analysis once said "If you torture the data long enough, it will confess." Never use this practice!

You can do awesome things with your data science skills: cure diseases, analyze health data, prevent climate change, improve your city, or fact check politicians. Don't let your biases or mistakes come in the way.
